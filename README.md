# Database Project (Node Js and Mysql)
> **NOTE:** Steps how to begin

1. **Do a npm install first for node modules:**

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

2. **To Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run start-server
   ```
3. **Please insert or run the SQL file first it is located in the Server folder:** <br>
   **I would recommend MYSQL Workbench**
So config file for DB connection will depend on your port, user, password, and database.
```bash
   host: "localhost",port: "",user: "",password: "",database: "",
   ```

4. **To Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
